android-touch-regions
=====================

Wondered how to make a map where the user could touch different regions and detect those actions?
Or maybe a Car wireframe?
Body parts or maybe a way to implement a paint for kids app?

android-touch-regions manages touchable and selectable regions.

Here is an example of a Westeros (+ the western part of Essos) with the different regions being selectable:
